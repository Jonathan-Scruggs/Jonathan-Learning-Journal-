## Features
- Responsive Site
- Click on articles to read them
- view more displays older posts
- Display other recent posts after clicking "View more"
## What I learnt 
- Learned the hard way that MPA's everytime a new page is loaded it results in a fresh execution context so all scripts for that page
  and corresponding modules are rexecuted. This can cause unexpected behavior.
- URL parameters using the URLSearchParams() construcotr and then using the .get() method on the URLSearchParams object to get the value of parameters.
- window.location.href to redirect users to differnt html pages.
- window.location.pathname.includes() to determine if we are on a certain page directory.
- Got practice with responsive design implementing a mobile first strategy.
- Learned that window.location is a object that essentially returns information about the current location of a document/URL.
